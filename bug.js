This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage a project. The exact error message varies, but it typically involves an issue with the project's configuration or dependencies.  One common scenario is when the `package.json` file is corrupted or missing necessary dependencies. Another potential cause is an incompatibility between Expo SDK versions or conflicting plugins.
