To resolve this, carefully examine the `package.json` file for any errors.  Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and that their versions are compatible. If any dependencies are missing or corrupted, reinstall them using `npm install` or `yarn install`. If version conflicts exist, check the package versions and use `npm-check-updates` or a similar tool to update your dependencies.  Also, verify that the Expo SDK version is compatible with your project and other installed plugins. If the error persists, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Finally, you might need to clean up your Expo cache by running `expo prebuild --clean` before building again.  Thorough review of the console output and error messages may be necessary to pinpoint the specific problem.
